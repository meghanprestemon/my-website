          <p>
            I am originally from upstate New York - near Syracuse which is literally <i>the</i> <a href="http://articles.niche.com/top-25-snowiest-cities-in-america/">snowiest city</a> in the United States; beating the next snowiest city by <a href="https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/20-snowiest-large-cities-america-20140130#/20">over 25 inches</a>. I now live in Alameda with my husband, Rob. We've been in the Bay Area for about 4 years and are happy to call it home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before starting my journey into web development I had quite a few different jobs in varying fields. I got my bachelors degree in psychology and was a counselor when I lived in New York. After leaving New York I've had positions as an administrative assistant for different organizations including a law firm, a state university, and a mental health nonprofit. I have also been the manager of an organic mattress retailer and manager of a yoga studio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding a lack of fulfillment and engagement in these fields I knew it was time for something new and challenging...  so here I am!
